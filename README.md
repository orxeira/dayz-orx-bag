<h1>OrxBag</h1>
The OrxBag is a work in progress mod for a backpack that can be customized by a server admin in size and slots.
  
In the current version the bag is a reskin of the Mountain backpack. There are 4 variants with 100 slots:  
  
* OrxeiraBag_Green  
* OrxeiraBag_Blue  
* OrxeiraBag_Desert  
* OrxeiraBag_Fall  
  
There is also a variant with 110 slots which is intended to be a prize or a one-of-a-kind item in the server:  
  
* OrxeiraBag_Pink  
  
Feel free to repack and use this mod as you please. Credit is appreciated but not required.

Planned features:
1. Add config for server admins to change bag name, description and bag size.
2. Expand config to be usable per bag.
3. Add extra attachment slots to bag.
4. Use custom model.
